We have decided on a team consisting of Phil, Jon Quinn, Adam, John Collins, and Josh. This team was decided upon based on experience, seniority, and time until graduation. \n\nFor those that are interested in a hackathon, Spartahacks is in January and due to how close it is and the lower cost we would like to send at least one team to it. If you are interested in that please let us know.",
